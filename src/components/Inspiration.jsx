      I often wished for an easy way to help me feel freer.
    </p>

    <p>
      One evening while attending to a tedious chore, an idea struck me. It was a simple idea that would make a big difference. This idea became the initial seed that grew into the book <b>Unsubscribe</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the ideas developed on paper, I began implementing them in my own life. I can tell you firsthand that they work!
    </p>

    <p>
      But don’t just take it from me. Many early readers of <b>Unsubscribe</b> have shared their stories and various ways in which they are using what they’ve discovered in this small but mighty book. It has been a catalyst to change in their lives. May the same be true for you!
