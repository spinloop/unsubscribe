      I knew I was on to something when I would write long hand or type on the computer and my hands were throbbing because I could not keep up with the flow of ideas that would come. As I wrote and watched these ideas develop on paper I started to implement them in my own life. I can tell you first hand that they work! As you can see by the comments by the early readers in the slide show above, others are also using what they discover in <em>Unsubscribe</em> and changing the way they live their lives.
