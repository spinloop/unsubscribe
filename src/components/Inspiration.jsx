      …I often wished for an easy way to help me feel less weighed down and freer. One evening while attending to a tedious chore, an idea struck me that there was something that actually could help. This idea became the initial seed that grew into the book <b>Unsubscribe</b>: <em>Your Key to Unlock The Door to Change</em>.

      I knew I was onto something because whether I was writing in longhand or typing on the computer, my hands were throbbing the entire time. I could barely keep up with the flow of ideas and thoughts that came through me.

      But don’t just take it from me. Numerous early readers of the manuscript have shared their stories of the multiple and various ways in which they are using what they’ve discovered in this small but mighty book to change the way they live their lives. May the same be true for you!
