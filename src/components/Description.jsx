      Keith, however, felt far from it. He was frustrated about how his life had become so busy with things he did not want. So busy, in fact, that he could not even be grateful for what he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this changes late one Saturday when he decides to tackle some of the chores on the ever growing "honey-do" list that his wife has posted on the fridge. The one thing on the list that has infuriated him the most is what ultimately leads him to his freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long he finds himself moving up the corporate ladder and rebuilding his relationship with his wife and kids. Ultimately he is even credited with transforming the company he works for.
